### Description:

Sentiment analysis determines whether text expresses positive, negative, or neutral emotion. In this project, we build a binary sentiment classifier for movie reviews using the IMDb dataset (or custom input). Weâ€™ll apply TF-IDF vectorization and train a Logistic Regression model using scikit-learn.

- Uses TF-IDF vectorization for converting text into numeric form
- Trains a logistic regression classifier for binary sentiment detection
- Visualizes results using confusion matrix and detailed performance report

## Sentiment Analysis with Logistic Regression

This script demonstrates a simple sentiment analysis pipeline using scikit-learn, ideal for educational and prototype purposes.

### ðŸ›  Installation

Make sure you have the required libraries installed:

```bash
pip install sklearn matplotlib seaborn
```

### ðŸ“„ Description

This code uses a small set of movie reviews labeled as either positive (`1`) or negative (`0`) and trains a logistic regression classifier to predict sentiment.

### ðŸ”„ Workflow Breakdown

1. **Import Libraries**

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_files
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

These libraries handle text preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and plotting.

2. **Prepare Dataset**

```python
reviews = [
    "I absolutely loved this movie. The story was fantastic and acting was brilliant.",
    "This was a waste of time. Horrible plot and bad direction.",
    "Great film! Will definitely watch again.",
    "Terrible experience. I walked out halfway.",
    "Not bad, but could have been better.",
    "Best movie Iâ€™ve seen this year!",
    "Awful. Just awful. Please donâ€™t watch.",
    "A masterpiece. Well done to the cast.",
    "I didnâ€™t like the movie. It was boring.",
    "Amazing movie! Beautiful visuals and emotional story."
]
labels = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]  # 1 = Positive, 0 = Negative
```

We use a simple predefined dataset of 10 reviews and their sentiment labels.

3. **Train-Test Split**

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(reviews, labels, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
```

This splits the dataset into 70% training and 30% testing data.

4. **Text Vectorization with TF-IDF**

```python
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english', max_features=1000)
X_train_vec = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_vec = vectorizer.transform(X_test)
```

TF-IDF is used to convert text data into numerical vectors while removing common English stopwords.

5. **Train the Model**

```python
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train_vec, y_train)
```

We train a logistic regression model using the vectorized training data.

6. **Evaluate the Model**

```python
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_vec)
print("Classification Report:\n")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

We print out precision, recall, and F1-score using the classification report.

7. **Confusion Matrix Visualization**

```python
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt="d", cmap="Greens", xticklabels=["Neg", "Pos"], yticklabels=["Neg", "Pos"])
plt.title("Confusion Matrix - Sentiment Analysis")
plt.xlabel("Predicted")
plt.ylabel("Actual")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

This block visualizes the confusion matrix to better understand the classification performance.

### âœ… Output

You will see a classification report and a confusion matrix heatmap showing how well the model performed on the test data.

### ðŸ“Œ Notes

* For production use, use a larger dataset and consider deep learning models or more advanced feature extraction methods.
* Tune hyperparameters (e.g., vectorizer options or logistic regression settings) for improved accuracy.

Happy Sentiment Analyzing! ðŸš€
